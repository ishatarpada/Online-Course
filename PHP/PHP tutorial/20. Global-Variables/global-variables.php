    PHP Global Variables - Superglobals
        Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.

        The PHP superglobals variables are:

        $GLOBALS
        $_SERVER
        $_REQUEST
        $_POST
        $_GET
        $_FILES
        $_ENV
        $_COOKIE
        $_SESSION

     -->
