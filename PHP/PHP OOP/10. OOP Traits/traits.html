    <h1>Traits</h1>
    <p>PHP only supports single inheritance: a child class can inherit only from one single parent.</p>
    <p>Traits are used to declare methods that can be used in multiple classes. Traits can have methods and abstract
        methods that can be used in multiple classes, and the methods can have any access modifier (public, private, or
        protected).</p>

    <p>Traits are declared with the trait keyword</p>
